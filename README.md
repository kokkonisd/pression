### Projet PeiP2
---

An arduino project about correcting siting posture. 
It will use 50kg load sensors placed under chair feet coupled with HX711 amplifiers to retrieve data from the load sensors.
This data will then be acquired by an Arduino and sent via Serial communication to a Java program on PC which determines the actual posture based on load sensors values.

Force-voltage equation:

Vo = Vcc ( R / (R + FSR) )
